# Bitcoin Web Ticker

This is a quick and dirty implementation of a full-page ticker for Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash.

It is made in PHP and contains all dependencies it needs. It pulls price data from Kraken (currently the only exchange supported).

To use, just follow the instructions:

## How to use

1. Have a `bitcoind` or `bitcoin-qt` running and configured to accept RPC calls.<br>Read more about this [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Running_Bitcoin).
2. Duplicate the file `config.example.php` into `config.php` and fill out the credentials as explained.
3. Serve the files from a PHP capable server and open the page.
4. Voil√†!

## Details

The displayed data is as follows:

<table style="text-align: center;">
	<tr>
		<td colspan="3">Bitcoin Cash Price<br>24h Price Average</td>
		<td colspan="3">Bitcoin Core Price<br>24h Price Average</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2">RPC Server Status</td>
		<td colspan="2">RPC Server Block Height</td>
		<td colspan="2">RPC Server Connections Count</td>
	<tr>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="3">RPC Server Reported Difficulty</td>
		<td colspan="3">RPC Server Reported Net Hashrate</td>
	</tr>
</table>

## Configurations

The available configurations (apart from credentials) are:

* `$configuration['refresh_rate']`<br>The refresh rate for the page, in seconds. Set it to `null` to disable the meta-refresh tag from being inserted.
* `$configuration['fiat_currency']`<br>The fiat currency to use for prices. Currently the only tested ones are `EUR` for Euros and `USD` for American Dollars.
